# Phase 1 Project

![Movie Analysis](https://github.com/vkeya/dsc-phase1-project/blob/master/images/movie.jpg)

## Overview

This project analyzes the popular movie databases around the world. Descriptive analysis of popular movie genres and their average rating shows some genres are rated very high and also the producers involved with these movies also influence the average ratings.

### Business Problem

Google sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis, including genre trends over time. Popular genres and influence directors have on movie ratings.

## Conclusions

As a consultant for Google, based on my findings and insights i will propose the below:-

Google to focus on the most popular, highly produced movie genres from the past decade, this includes Drama, Documentary, Comedy, ComedyDrama, AdventureComedy and Drama. The data shows these Genres did significantly well the past decade and it continues to rise. We can also see a significant higher rating for this genres which means the viewers are significantly impressed by them which guarantees views and revenuw for Google.

Since we see a significant popularity in these genres, Google can also get into the business of producing Documentaries in various aspects of life, buy rights also from already existing documentaries.

Also an anlysis into the directors who were involved with this movies show they have significant higher ratings compared to others, the way google can leverage on this is by seeking movies directed by these individuals and showing them, since we clearly see a direct relationship between a director and the movie.

Also Google can seek out these Directors, get into contract with them for future patnership projects since we already have data showing they have high ratings.By doing this they will have rights and royalties for future projects leading to longterm revenue generation.

By identifying top-performing directors and genres, the analysis can assist Google in allocating resources effectively and maximizing the chances of success for their movies.

## Next Steps

Further analysis could yield additional insights to further assist google in decision making:

Budget vs. Revenue: Investigate the relationship between production budget and box office revenue.

Production Companies: Analyze the performance of movies produced by different production companies.

Social Media Mentions: Analyze the correlation between social media mentions and movie ratings/popularity.

Awards and Nominations: Explore whether movies nominated for or awarded prestigious awards tend to perform better.
